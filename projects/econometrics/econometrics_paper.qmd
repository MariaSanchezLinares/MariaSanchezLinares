<br> Universal free school meal policies are reshaping how we think about food access and equity in education. In this project, I investigate how these policies impact **student performance and engagement** in U.S. public schools.

Millions of children in the U.S. experience food insecurity—particularly those whose family income is too high to qualify for free lunch, yet too low to afford meals regularly. Universal meal legislation eliminates this barrier by offering free breakfast and lunch to **all students, regardless of income**.

As of the 2024–2025 school year, **nine states** have adopted these programs, including California, Minnesota, and Massachusetts. My research compares these early adopters with other states still following the traditional income-based model.

### Research Focus

Using **difference-in-differences econometric methods**, I assess whether universal free meal programs improved:

- Academic proficiency (in ELA, Math, Science)
- Student attendance
- Enrollment and retention

The goal? To offer new insights into whether this policy actually moves the needle on educational outcomes.
