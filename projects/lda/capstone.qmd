This project was completed as part of my **senior capstone in Data Science** at Macalester College. My goal was to combine natural language processing, political context, and data storytelling to better. 

Motivated by a deep history of ongoing complexities, this study explores how political events, economic crises, and migration trends shape media discourse. However, analyzing a large body of news articles is a challenging task. In this project, I employed topic modeling ‚Äîan unsupervised machine learning technique used in natural language processing‚Äî to identify evolving narratives about Venezuela-Colombia relations as portrayed by **two major newspapers El Tiempo and El Espectador,**  across **5,061 articles** published since 2017.
