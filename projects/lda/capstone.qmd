This project was completed as part of my **senior capstone in Data Science** at Macalester College. My goal was to combine natural language processing, political context, and data storytelling to better understand how migration and diplomacy are framed in Colombian media over time.

#### Context  
Venezuela and Colombia share a complex relationship shaped by decades of migration, conflict, and diplomacy. In recent years, the Venezuelan humanitarian crisis triggered a dramatic reversal in migration patterns: millions of Venezuelans have sought refuge in Colombia. Political tensions and realignments‚Äîlike the 2022 election of Colombia‚Äôs first leftist president, Gustavo Petro‚Äîhave also reshaped the public discourse.

#### Research Questions  
- What are the dominant themes in Colombian media coverage of Venezuela‚ÄìColombia relations?  
- How have these narratives shifted in response to migration trends and political events?

#### Methods  
We collected and analyzed **5,000+ articles** from two major Colombian newspapers:  
- *El Tiempo* (center-right)  
- *El Espectador* (left-leaning)  

After cleaning and tokenizing the text, we calculated **TF-IDF scores** to filter out low-importance words and applied **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)** to extract dominant topics across articles. Each article was assigned to a topic using gamma scores, and we used multiple metrics to validate the number of topics for interpretability.

#### What We Found  
We uncovered a range of themes, including:  
- **Migration & Humanitarian Crisis**  
- **Diplomacy and Foreign Policy**  
- **Venezuelan and Colombian Politics**  
- **Security and Guerrilla Groups**  
- **Public Health and COVID-19**  
- **Environmental Degradation**  
- **Migrant Human Trafficking**

We also tracked how the frequency of these topics changed over time. For instance, migration reporting surged during 2018‚Äì2020, while diplomatic coverage spiked after Petro‚Äôs election.

#### Why It Matters  
This project highlights how media shapes and reflects national narratives during times of crisis. By using unsupervised learning to trace these patterns, we gained a better understanding of how migration and geopolitics are framed for the public.
