Data invisibility is a pressing societal issue. When certain groups are excluded or misrepresented in datasets, it distorts our understanding of social realities and reinforces harmful stereotypes. The underrepresentation of transgender individuals in official statistics is one such gapâ€”with real consequences for policy and public perception.

<br> In this project, I explored **two primary research questions**:  
- *What are the key challenges and considerations in accurately representing transgender individuals within official datasets?*  
- *What is the current state of data representation efforts for transgender populations, who is driving these initiatives, and why do they matter?*

<br> My approach involved qualitative research through literature reviews, along with data analysis using R tools focused on SOGI (Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity) variables in U.S. federal surveys.

### Key Findings

- **Self-identification barriers**: Fixed-response categories often fail to capture the complexity and fluidity of gender identity.
- **Privacy risks**: Concerns are growing due to evolving legislation that affects LGBTQ+ rights.
- **Trust gaps**: Lack of community involvement can hinder participation and data quality.

<br> These issues point to a need for more inclusive methods (e.g., write-in responses), robust privacy safeguards, and deeper collaboration with affected communities.

### Why It Matters

Driving many of the positive changes in SOGI data collection are **civil society organizations and academic researchers**, who are leading responsible and ethical initiatives. Collecting comprehensive gender minority data is essential for:

- Understanding health and social disparities  
- Advancing well-being  
- Developing evidence-based, inclusive public policies

### Next Steps

I completed this study as a Research Fellow at the UVA School of Data Science under the guidance of **Professor Jess Reia**. 

The findings from this project will be incorporated into a report for the **Center for Global Health Equity at the University of Virginia**. I also plan to expand this research by exploring broader datasets and contributing to the global conversation on inclusive data science and SOGI representation.
