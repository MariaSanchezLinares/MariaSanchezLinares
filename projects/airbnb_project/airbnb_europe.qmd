<br> **From Data to Destinations: Visual Analysis of European Airbnbs**
<br> In this data science research project, we studied European Airbnb listings using a sample of 10 major cities. To support this analysis, we developed an interactive **Shiny App** that allows users to explore a series of data visualizations examining the factors correlated with *price* and *guest satisfaction*.

<br> For future work, I am developing a predictive model capable of estimating prices for new listings (out-of-sample data) based on features input by the user.

<br> **About the Data**
<br> Data was collected approximately four to six weeks before the planned travel dates. Prices reflect the total amount required for the accommodation, including reservation and cleaning fees, for a two-night stay.
