**Can proximity to interstate highways reduce a person's chance of climbing the economic ladder?**  
This research investigates how living near U.S. highways impacts social mobility, focusing on three key factors:

- Air pollution
- Job density
- Absolute mobility

Using data from major U.S. cities, the study applies multiple regression analysis with data from the **Opportunity Atlas** and **Social Capital Project** to assess the relationship between highway proximity and economic outcomes.

### Key Findings

- Living near highways is linked to **lower upward mobility**, driven by pollution exposure and reduced access to key resources.
- Interstate systems may play a role in **perpetuating socioeconomic disparities**, rather than bridging opportunity gaps.
