In the heart of New York Cityâ€™s vibrant and ever-evolving rental landscape, thousands of Airbnb listings compete for attentionâ€”ranging from compact studios in Manhattan to sprawling lofts in Brooklyn. These listings differ not just in location, but in amenities, property type, and host features.

<br> This project takes a closer look at the factors behind Airbnb pricing, focusing on two key questions:

- **Can we forecast the price of an AirBnb listing based on its features?**  
- **What are the discerning characteristics that elevate some listings to a higher price bracket than others?**


<br>  To answer these questions, I used statistical modeling and machine learning algorithmsâ€”specifically, Least Squares Regression and LASSOâ€”to explore correlations and build predictive models. Drawing from a cleaned dataset of 5,000 listings across NYCâ€™s five boroughs, I analyzed 23 key variables, such as number of bedrooms, host status, amenities (i.e.: gym, doorman, or TV), and neighborhood group.
