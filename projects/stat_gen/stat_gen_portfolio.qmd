This site is an interactive resource I designed to explain core concepts in statistical genetics in a clear, approachable way. It covers topics like Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS), and multiple testing correctionsâ€”blending data science, ethical and social context, etc.

Created as a learning reflection exercise, this site is meant for students, researchers, or anyone curious about exploring genetics using statistics and programming tools.
