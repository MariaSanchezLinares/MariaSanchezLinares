### Overview

This project explores key methods from the paper *‚ÄúAdaptation to the cervical environment is associated with increased antibiotic susceptibility in Neisseria gonorrhoeae‚Äù* by Ma et al., showing how Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) can help uncover genetic factors linked to antibiotic susceptibility in *Neisseria gonorrhoeae*, the bacterium that causes gonorrhea.

### What We Did

To make this research more accessible, we created a dedicated website where we:

- Break down the **biology and genetics** behind *N. gonorrhoeae*
- Explain the **GWAS methodology** used in the study
- Walk through a **replication** of the paper‚Äôs GWAS focused on azithromycin resistance

While the original paper investigates resistance to three key antibiotics‚Äî**azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, and ceftriaxone**‚Äîand explores how bacterial location within the human body affects evolution, we zoom in on one part of this dataset focusing only on azithromycin.

Our goal is to illustrate how rigorous statistical genetics methods can be applied to pressing public health challenges, while providing a beginner-friendly introduction to microbial GWAS.
