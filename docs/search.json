    "text": "In the heart of the bustling metropolis that is New York City, a dynamic marketplace of AirBnb listings unfolds, offering a plethora of accommodations to travelers from all corners of the globe. From snug apartments in the heart of Manhattan to expansive lofts in Brooklyn, these listings not only span the spectrum in terms of location but also come with a rich array of features and amenities. I embark on a statistical exploration to uncover the underlying factors that dictate the price of these listings. This study revolved around two pivotal questions:\n\nPredicting Airbnb Listing Prices: Can we forecast the price of an AirBnb listing based on its features?\nThe Anatomy of Price Differences: What are the discerning characteristics that elevate some listings to a higher price bracket than others?\n\nProducts\n\nReport"

    "section": "",
    "text": "In this study, my aim was to delve into the intricate relationship between economic indicators and life expectancy, questioning the adequacy of conventional country classifications. Life Expectancy (LE) isn’t just a measure of healthcare quality; it’s a multifaceted indicator reflecting a nation’s economic, social, and environmental status.\nUsing WHO and UN data, I discovered a positive correlation between a country’s Income Composition of Resources (ICOR) and life expectancy. Even a small increase in ICOR was associated with a notable rise in life expectancy, challenging the simplistic “developed” versus “developing” country categories.\nThis study highlights the limitations of relying solely on economic indicators. While developed nations generally exhibit higher life expectancies, some developing countries effectively utilize resources to surpass global life expectancy averages.\nIt emphasizes the need for a comprehensive approach, integrating social, cultural, and political factors alongside economic indicators to grasp life expectancy determinants fully. This work opens pathways for future exploration, urging a broader analysis of non-economic influences and resource utilization for a deeper understanding of global life expectancy dynamics.\nProducts\n\nReport"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Data invisibility is a pressing societal issue, leaving certain groups excluded and misrepresented, which distorts our social understanding and perpetuates stereotypes. The lack of transgender representation in official datasets is a clear example of this, impacting policies and societal perceptions. Despite efforts for data justice, transgender data remains scarce in surveys, limiting our grasp of LGBTQI+ experiences.\nIn my project, I tackle two primary research questions:\n- What are the key challenges and considerations in accurately representing transgender individuals within official datasets?\n- What is the current state of data representation efforts on the transgender population, who is driving these initiatives, and why are they significant?\nI conducted qualitative research, delving into literature reviews and using RStudio for data analysis on SOGI-related collection in federal surveys.\nThe findings shed light on three critical hurdles in collecting transgender data: limitations in self-identification methods, privacy concerns, and the need to build trust. Surveys’ fixed categories often fail to capture the fluidity of gender identity, and privacy risks loom large amidst changing legislation impacting LGBTQ rights. Addressing these issues requires more inclusive methods, like write-in responses, alongside stringent privacy safeguards and community collaborations to foster trust.\nDriving these data collection efforts are civil-society organizations and academia, leading responsible initiatives for gender minorities. Comprehensive SOGI data is indispensable for understanding disparities, enhancing well-being, and crafting evidence-based policies.\nNext steps for this project include incorporating the findings from the study into the report being developed for the Center for Global Health Equity at the University of Virginia. Additionally, accessing and exploring wider data sources is key to expanding the findings of this study, hoping that it will contribute to global conversation about SOGI data collection and responsible data science.\nProducts\n\nSlides\nPoster"

    "section": "",
    "text": "This paper explores the potential consequences of residing near United States highways on social mobility, focusing on air pollution, job density, and absolute mobility. Investigating major cities within the U.S., the research employs a multiple regression analysis using the Opportunity Atlas and Social Capital data libraries to gauge the significance of highways in shaping mobility prospects. Findings reveal that highway proximity can hinder upward mobility due to factors like pollution exposure and limited resource access. Through this exploration, the paper sheds light on the multifaceted effects of highways, offering insights into their role in perpetuating socioeconomic disparities.\nI worked on this study under the guidance of Prof. Bruich from the Harvard University Department of Economics, and in collaboration with Ruhama Baruda, Sarah Hassan, Angela Hilliard and Cady Ngo.\nProducts\n\nReport\nPoster"
