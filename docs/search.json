After finishing the International Baccalaureate diploma, I moved to Saint Paul, MN to start my undergraduate studies at Macalester College.\nI find joy in embracing new adventures and experiences. I am not your typical outdoors enthusiast, but I like skiing and kayaking. I also enjoy exploring new flavors through food touring and baking.\nMost recently, I am preparing for my next journey. I have always loved traveling, and I am excited to be studying abroad in Málaga, Spain come spring 2024."
