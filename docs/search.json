To support this analysis, we developed an interactive Shiny App that allows users to explore a series of data visualizations examining the factors correlated with price and guest satisfaction.\n For future work, I am developing a predictive model capable of estimating prices for new listings (out-of-sample data) based on features input by the user.\n About the Data  Data was collected approximately four to six weeks before the planned travel dates. Prices reflect the total amount required for the accommodation, including reservation and cleaning fees, for a two-night stay.\n Source: Khemani, D. (2023, March 25). Airbnb Cleaned Europe Dataset.

    "text": "In the heart of New York City‚Äôs vibrant and ever-evolving rental landscape, thousands of Airbnb listings compete for attention‚Äîranging from compact studios in Manhattan to sprawling lofts in Brooklyn. These listings differ not just in location, but in amenities, property type, and host features.\n This project takes a closer look at the factors behind Airbnb pricing, focusing on two key questions:\n\nCan we forecast the price of an AirBnb listing based on its features?\n\nWhat are the discerning characteristics that elevate some listings to a higher price bracket than others?\n\n To answer these questions, I used statistical modeling and machine learning algorithms‚Äîspecifically, Least Squares Regression and LASSO‚Äîto explore correlations and build predictive models. Drawing from a cleaned dataset of 5,000 listings across NYC‚Äôs five boroughs, I analyzed 23 key variables, such as number of bedrooms, host status, amenities (i.e.: gym, doorman, or TV), and neighborhood group.\n\nüìÑ Report\nTo learn more about the methods, findings, and visualizations used in this project, view the full report below:"

    "text": "This project was completed as part of my senior capstone in Data Science at Macalester College. My goal was to combine natural language processing, political context, and data storytelling to better understand how migration and diplomacy are framed in Colombian media over time.\n\nContext\nVenezuela and Colombia share a complex relationship shaped by decades of migration, conflict, and diplomacy. In recent years, the Venezuelan humanitarian crisis triggered a dramatic reversal in migration patterns: millions of Venezuelans have sought refuge in Colombia. Political tensions and realignments‚Äîlike the 2022 election of Colombia‚Äôs first leftist president, Gustavo Petro‚Äîhave also reshaped the public discourse.\n\n\nResearch Questions\n\nWhat are the dominant themes in Colombian media coverage of Venezuela‚ÄìColombia relations?\n\nHow have these narratives shifted in response to migration trends and political events?\n\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected and analyzed 5,000+ articles from two major Colombian newspapers:\n- El Tiempo (center-right)\n- El Espectador (left-leaning)\nAfter cleaning and tokenizing the text, we calculated TF-IDF scores to filter out low-importance words and applied Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to extract dominant topics across articles. Each article was assigned to a topic using gamma scores, and we used multiple metrics to validate the number of topics for interpretability.\n\n\nWhat We Found\nWe uncovered a range of themes, including:\n- Migration & Humanitarian Crisis\n- Diplomacy and Foreign Policy\n- Venezuelan and Colombian Politics\n- Security and Guerrilla Groups\n- Public Health and COVID-19\n- Environmental Degradation\n- Migrant Human Trafficking\nWe also tracked how the frequency of these topics changed over time. For instance, migration reporting surged during 2018‚Äì2020, while diplomatic coverage spiked after Petro‚Äôs election.\n\n\nWhy It Matters\nThis project highlights how media shapes and reflects national narratives during times of crisis. By using unsupervised learning to trace these patterns, we gained a better understanding of how migration and geopolitics are framed for the public.\n\n\nü§ù Collaborators\nNibia Becerra and Emanuel Deleon\nView full slides"

    "section": "",
    "text": "In this study, my aim was to delve into the intricate relationship between economic indicators and life expectancy, questioning the adequacy of conventional country classifications. Life Expectancy (LE) isn‚Äôt just a measure of healthcare quality; it‚Äôs a multifaceted indicator reflecting a nation‚Äôs economic, social, and environmental status.\nUsing WHO and UN data, I discovered a positive correlation between a country‚Äôs Income Composition of Resources (ICOR) and life expectancy. Even a small increase in ICOR was associated with a notable rise in life expectancy, challenging the simplistic ‚Äúdeveloped‚Äù versus ‚Äúdeveloping‚Äù country categories.\nThis study highlights the limitations of relying solely on economic indicators. While developed nations generally exhibit higher life expectancies, some developing countries effectively utilize resources to surpass global life expectancy averages.\nIt emphasizes the need for a comprehensive approach, integrating social, cultural, and political factors alongside economic indicators to grasp life expectancy determinants fully. This work opens pathways for future exploration, urging a broader analysis of non-economic influences and resource utilization for a deeper understanding of global life expectancy dynamics.\nProducts\n\nReport"

    "text": "Data invisibility is a pressing societal issue. When certain groups are excluded or misrepresented in datasets, it distorts our understanding of social realities and reinforces harmful stereotypes. The underrepresentation of transgender individuals in official statistics is one such gap‚Äîwith real consequences for policy and public perception.\n In this project, I explored two primary research questions:\n- What are the key challenges and considerations in accurately representing transgender individuals within official datasets?\n- What is the current state of data representation efforts for transgender populations, who is driving these initiatives, and why do they matter?\n My approach involved qualitative research through literature reviews, along with data analysis using R tools focused on SOGI (Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity) variables in U.S. federal surveys.\n\n\n\n\nBar chart showing SOGI survey inclusion\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Findings\n\nSelf-identification barriers: Fixed-response categories often fail to capture the complexity and fluidity of gender identity.\nPrivacy risks: Concerns are growing due to evolving legislation that affects LGBTQ+ rights.\nTrust gaps: Lack of community involvement can hinder participation and data quality.\n\n These issues point to a need for more inclusive methods (e.g., write-in responses), robust privacy safeguards, and deeper collaboration with affected communities.\n\n\n\nWhy It Matters\nDriving many of the positive changes in SOGI data collection are civil society organizations and academic researchers, who are leading responsible and ethical initiatives. Collecting comprehensive gender minority data is essential for:\n\nUnderstanding health and social disparities\n\nAdvancing well-being\n\nDeveloping evidence-based, inclusive public policies\n\n\n\n\nNext Steps\nI completed this study as a Research Fellow at the UVA School of Data Science under the guidance of Professor Jess Reia.\nThe findings from this project will be incorporated into a report for the Center for Global Health Equity at the University of Virginia.

In this project, I investigate how these policies impact student performance and engagement in U.S. public schools.\nMillions of children in the U.S. experience food insecurity‚Äîparticularly those whose family income is too high to qualify for free lunch, yet too low to afford meals regularly. Universal meal legislation eliminates this barrier by offering free breakfast and lunch to all students, regardless of income.\nAs of the 2024‚Äì2025 school year, nine states have adopted these programs, including California, Minnesota, and Massachusetts. My research compares these early adopters with other states still following the traditional income-based model.\n\nResearch Focus\nUsing difference-in-differences econometric methods, I assess whether universal free meal programs improved:\n\nAcademic proficiency (in ELA, Math, Science)\nStudent attendance\nEnrollment and retention\n\nThe goal? To offer new insights into whether this policy actually moves the needle on educational outcomes.\n\n\nFinal Paper\nYou can read the full research paper here:\n\n\nThis project was completed under the guidance of Professor Amy Damon for my Introduction to Econometrics course."
