## About me

I’m a data scientist with a background in economics and a strong interest in interdisciplinary research that brings together statistical thinking and social impact. My academic journey at Macalester College along with a diverse research trajectory sparked a passion for using quantitative tools to explore complex questions. Thus, I have had the opportunity to engage in multiple projects in the areas of education, health equity, economics and finance, media, and even microbial genetics.

Across my work, I’ve found that what excites me most is diving into unfamiliar questions, learning new tools or methods along the way, and finding creative solutions.
