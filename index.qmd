## About me

I am data science and economics student largely interested in solving social and economic problems with data-based solution. I have coursework Data Analysis and Visualization, Machine Learning, Statistical Modeling, Environmental and Economic Policy. I have a foundation in data-driven research and am looking for opportunities to get hands-on work experience. I have a passion for social justice, and blending my expertise, I aim to leverage data to inform innovative solutions to real-world challenges in the business and policy-making realms.

## Personal

I was born and raised in Valencia, Venezuela. At the age of 18, I received a [United World College](https://www.uwc.org/about) scholarship to attend UWC Red Cross Nordic in Flekke, Norway. After finishing the International Baccalaureate diploma, I moved to Saint Paul, MN to start my undergraduate studies at Macalester College.

I find joy in embracing new adventures and experiences. I am not your typical outdoors enthusiast, but I like skiing and kayaking. I also enjoy exploring new flavors through food touring and baking. 

Most recently, I am preparing for my next journey. I have always loved traveling, and I am excited to be studying abroad in Málaga, Spain come spring 2024.
